This is just a proof-of-concept that split-inbox'd GMail can work with Todoist for Gmail, with slight modification.

I hope TD developers incorporate it soon for everyone =) (in the meantime you can just clone the repository and load the extension manually from a folder: Settings -> Extensions -> Load unpacked extension)
